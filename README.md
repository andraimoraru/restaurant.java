dine in customers as shown in Table 1. Customers can order collections and

Requirements:
Create a working Java programme in stages (Design,
Code and Test) to meet the following requirements:
1) The programme should have the following three options as part of the
menu.
a) Place order.
b) Display invoice.
c) Exit
2) The menu should be displayed after each option is executed to enable
suitable user choice (looped menu).
a) Only valid entry choice for Exit should end the program.
3) The programme should take user input from keyboard for the choices and
data entry. Validate user inputs to avoid errors.
4) The programme should employ only fixed arrays where necessary –
dynamic arrays (i.e. ArrayList, vector, HashMap, etc.) are not to be used.
5) Additional suitable entries to be created for Table 2 as indicated.
6) The program should display the final invoice as displayed in Table 3.
7) The menu data does not need to be stored in the program. However,
values for creating an order entry should be taken from menu items
provided in Table 4.
